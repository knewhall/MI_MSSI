# MI_MSSI
self time-delayed mutual information of time series data

## compute_MI_of_MSSI.py
This file computes the time-delayed self mutual information of the straightness index time series data

It calls the function from the files MI_Functions_Copy.py and Sampling_Timelag_Copy.py

## compute_msd.py
This file computes the mean squared displacement of the trajectory data

## compute_vcf.py
This file computes the velocity correlation function of the trajectory data

## run_paths_pool.py
This file generates the trajectory data of the self-avoidant droplet model

It calls functions from Combined_fxns_single_2D.py for the full model or can be changed to call functions from Combined_trunc_fxns_single_2D.py for the truncated time-integral model
